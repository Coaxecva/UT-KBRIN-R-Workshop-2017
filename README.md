# UT-KBRIN-R-Workshop-2017 
(from Dr. Katie Thompson)

Welcome!
Part 1 (12-3pm): Introduction to Data Analysis with R

Designed from a practical data analysis perspective, this workshop aims to familiarize participants with using R to understand and visualize data sets by focusing on aspects of data analysis relevant to scientific researchers. Specifically, we will start with opening data in R, followed by understanding and visualizing data in R, and finishing with some basic data analyses in R. This part of the workshop will be geared toward participants who are new to command-line programming, or familiar with programming but unfamiliar with R.

Part 2 (3-5pm): How to Use and Create Interactive Shiny Applications

Shiny applications are web-based interfaces that allow users to run R software without programming or installing R. These can increase the impacts of new methodology by providing point-and-click implementations for users that are unfamiliar with coding. The first portion of this part will demonstrate use of a Shiny Application and is geared toward any researcher; the latter portion will focus on creation of Shiny Applications and rely more on participants’ programming experience.

Tentative Schedule:

*12-1pm: Introduction to RStudio/R, Reading Data into R

*1-2pm: Various data visualizations in R

*2-3pm: Basic Statistical Analysis in R

*3-3:45pm: Shiny Application Demo – Identifying Interaction Effects in Large Data Sets (shinyfsa.org)

*3:45-5pm: Creation of a Shiny Application
